        description: SelfSubjectRulesReview enumerates the set of actions the current
          user can perform within a namespace. The returned list of actions may be
          incomplete depending on the server's authorization mode, and any errors
          experienced during the evaluation. SelfSubjectRulesReview should be used
          by UIs to show/hide actions, or to quickly let an end user reason about
          their permissions. It should NOT Be used by external systems to drive authorization
          decisions as this raises confused deputy, cache lifetime/revocation, and
          correctness concerns. SubjectAccessReview, and LocalAccessReview are the
          correct way to defer authorization decisions to the API server.
